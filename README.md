## Sidecar Toggle Workflow
Use this workflow to quickly toggle the use of Sidecar to your iPad.

A quick and dirty workflow which uses the `tell SystemUIServer` process to do it from the menubar, supported in MacOS 11+ / when Sidecar was renamed to Screen Mirroring.

You must have Screen Mirroring visible as a Menu Bar icon.

**NOTE:** Will select the first screen mirroring device available on the list.
